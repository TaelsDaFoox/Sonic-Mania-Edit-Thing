# Sonic-Mania-Edit-Thing
It's just all the sonic mania assets except, like, code and stuff

Go and mess up the assets, let's make our own Sonic Mania Repainted

IMPORTANT:

I think that sprites don't work right if you use piskel or something so use aseprite or photoshop

ADD THINGS HERE THAT YOU'RE PLANNING TO DO:

Sega logo + sound -> Sega Scruffy intro (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vjj0aA933_s)

ADD THINGS HERE THAT YOU DID:

Christian whitehead logo -> orange poly logo
